Semgrep Documentation (Semgrep installation guide from Semgrep official website: https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/)
 


	I) Downloading Semgrep:


NOTE!!! : Semgrep OSS Engine is functional only on macOS, Linux, Docker and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) but it provides
the semgrep playground where you can write rules and analyse your code on line.
If you chose to use semgrep playground you can skip the next instructions as they explain


  * Prerequisite:

- Python 3.7 or later versions (you can download python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- If you're using Windows, you need to install WSL by running wsl --install command in Powershell executed as administrator
or by following the Microsoft Manual installation of WSL 
(https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/wsl/install-manual)


  *Installing Semgrep:

To install Semgrep try running the following command: python -m pip install semgrep

To confirm installation type: semgrep --version


	II) Writing code:

Semgrep enables developers to test their code even before it's compiled (Semgrep is designed to analyze source code which means .java files).
Thus to test java code with Semgrep we don't need JDK or any special editors installed.
We only need to save our code in a .java file using the text editor (under WSL when working with Windows).


	III) Writing rules:

To write the desired rules you can learn the correct syntax on https://semgrep.dev/docs/writing-rules/rule-syntax/
Next save the rules in a yml file.


	IV) Code analysis:

Let's assume our code file is called MyCode.java and the rule file is called RuleSet.yml to test our code we only need to run the following command 
semgrep --config RuleSet.yml MyCode.java
